// phase's spec is explicit: "do not blindly block self-target unless
// metadata/server contract says self-target is invalid" and "do not invent
// faction/team logic client-side." The server (add_character_effect etc.)
// already validates target existence honestly; this policy only checks
// that a target is SELECTED and LINKED to a real character, then lets the
// server accept or reject it.
