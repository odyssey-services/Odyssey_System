// Combat HUD — Instant / Self Ability Execution (Phase 4.1B.1) preconditions
// (PURE). No OBR, no DOM, no Supabase, no combat math.
//
// Sibling of directAbilityAttackPolicy.js, deliberately NOT merged with it:
// an instant/self ability has no target/body-zone concept at all — reusing
// the direct-attack policy's target checks would be dishonest (there is
// nothing to target). See docs/PHASE_4_1B_1_INSTANT_SELF_ABILITIES_AUDIT.md
// §5/6/7 for why: combat_execute_action/use_ability resolves the target to
// the acting character itself whenever none is supplied.
//
// combat_execute_action REQUIRES an active combat encounter (no free-play
// fallback, unlike perform_attack) — confirmed by reading the RPC's own
// body (ENCOUNTER_NOT_ACTIVE is the first possible rejection). This policy
// therefore blocks locally when no active session exists, rather than
// letting a doomed RPC call reach the server.
